# Personal Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website built with Jekyll. Below is the directory layout and instructions for setting up and customizing the site.

## Directory Layout

```plaintext
/ (root directory)
|-- _config.yml           # Main configuration file
|-- index.md              # Homepage or landing page
|-- _includes/            # Contains reusable partials like 'head-custom.html'
|   |-- head-custom.html  # Your custom HTML for including Font Awesome or other assets
|-- _layouts/             # Layouts (e.g., default.html)
|-- _posts/               # Blog posts, if you're using Jekyll's blog feature
|-- assets/               # Static files like CSS, images, or JS
|   |-- style.css         # Your custom stylesheet
|-- images/               # Directory for storing images (e.g., profile picture, etc.)
