## About Me

Aspiring Software Engineer!

## Projects

- Cheat-Detection System & PrairieLearn Integration: 
  Designed and built front-end tools in JavaScript for educators, providing a user-friendly interface to monitor flagged cheating behaviors, generate detailed reports, and interact with real-time data. Implemented the backend integration of Python-based detection algorithms with PrairieLearn's database, ensuring real-time data retrieval and synchronization between the detection system and educational assessments.
