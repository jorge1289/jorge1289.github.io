## Projects

- Cheat-Detection System & PrairieLearn Integration: 
  Designed and built front-end tools in JavaScript for educators, providing a user-friendly interface to monitor flagged cheating behaviors, generate detailed reports, and interact with real-time data. Implemented the backend integration of Python-based detection algorithms with PrairieLearn's database, ensuring real-time data retrieval and synchronization between the detection system and educational assessments. Focused on improving the usability and visualization of the system by creating dashboards that allowed educators to review suspicious patterns and student performance data easily.

- Database Project: Implemented a relational database system in Java that supports concurrency, and recovery.

- Gitlet: Gitlet is a simplified version-control system inspired by Git, designed to implement essential features for managing and tracking changes in a collection of files.

- Pac-Man AI: Collection of projects that use Pac-Man as a platform to explore and implement foundational AI techniques, such as search algorithms, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning.
